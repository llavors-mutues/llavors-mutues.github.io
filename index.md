# What is Llavors Mútues?

Llavors Mútues ("Mutual seeds") is an **open source working group centered around mutual-credit infrastructure on holochain**. 

It's not an application or set of happs, but instead **open source zomes and libraries** that can be composed to build one. 

# The Fit

So, where does Llavors Mutúes fit? 

Mutual-credit can come in many forms: private or public transactions, demurrage, fees, static or dynamic credit limits, fast or slow finality... **Every community and situation requires a slightly different pattern**.

But! Writing a mutual-credit DNA is **very difficult and time consuming**, and a lot of these patterns can emerge from combination of common building-blocks. **Llavors Mútues' mission is to build these common building blocks**, to reduce as much as possible the cost of setting up a new currency for a happ or community.

# What's next?

In the coming few months, we are going to be:

- Building of a mutual-credit transactor zome with **public transactions and demurrage**.
- Building of a **common UI for transactions**, starting from the UI we already have [here](https://github.com/llavors-mutual/private-slow-transactor/blob/master/ui).
- **Releasing both transactor zomes with proper documentation**.
- Building UI components to show **flow patterns of these current-sees**.
- Proposing a **common zome trait** for other happs to integrate with the transactor zomes.

# How can you help?

- If you are **developing a happ that needs mutual-credit** functionality, contact us!

We will shortly be proposing a zome trait standard together with the holochain community, and we need to make sure it works for everybody.

- If you are a happ or UI developer and **want to get involved**, contact us as well! 

There's quite a lot of work to do. You can visit our github to see what we have already built, and learn from it. 

- If you are a **commons or mutual-credit enthusiast**, you can try our tools as we build them and report feedback.

If you need a requirement we do not have covered well, tell us! We can also help you to setup for your unique use case.
